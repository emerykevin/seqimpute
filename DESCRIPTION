Title: Imputation of Missing Data in Sequence Analysis
Version: 2.2.0
Authors@R: c(
    person("Kevin", "Emery", , "kevin.emery@unige.ch", role = c("aut", "cre")),

Description: Multiple imputation of missing data in a dataset using MICT or 
    MICT-timing methods. The core idea of the algorithms is to fill gaps of 
    missing data, which is the typical form of missing data in a longitudinal 
    setting, recursively from their edges. Prediction is based on either a 
    multinomial or random forest regression model. Covariates and 
    time-dependent covariates can be included in the model.
